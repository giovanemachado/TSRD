<h2 id="#about-the-game"> About the game</h2>
You pilot a fly truck in tests whose purpose is to facilitate the construction of buildings! Just beside (your left, at the beginning) of the city there will be different blocks of buildings, and you must take them to the construction mark (your right, at the beginning). Stack them up there to see how to make a building stable and fast!

Download the game here: https://giovanemachado.itch.io/tsrd-transportes-para-construir-seus-sonhos

To control the truck, just pull all the levers and find out what they do! And don't forget the buttons at the backside.

To get a block, approach with the front of the truck on a block, then use the button at the backside of the truck to get it. There is a red laser that becomes green when it has a block in its range, to help you. Once that's done, just fly away with the block!

Dropping the block in the wrong place, or crashing this magnificent fly truck will cause a game over!

I have kept the game jam theme (Construction sounds) and used the idea of being inside a machine too. Inspired by Sea of Thieves (when you are controlling your ship) and Iron Lungs, I tried to explore this kind of situation, where you need to keep tracking of a lot of controls to do a specific task using it.

This was a 48h project for Game Jam Magalu! - 2022 (https://itch.io/jam/magalu), so most of the code does not has good refactoring or tests.

The game has a simple state machine that controls almost all the flow, besides hacks of the last hours.

I used Unity as my primary tool, a bit of Blender and Audacity. I created the levers animations inside Unity too.
